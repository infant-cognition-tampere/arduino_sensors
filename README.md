# arduino_sensors
This repository will hold small sensor codes used in our studies. We are moving
towards collecting as much data as possible in a single lab session and finding
ways to collect further different datasignals.

### Arduino?
Arduino is chosen as a sensor platform because it's cheap, easy to program and
is widely available. Also you can find lots of examples of different sensor
designs and projects on internet.

### Guidelines for adding new sensors
* make a new folder for each sensortype
* post sensor code on arduino
* post receiver-end code on pc
* post circuit graph as a png-file, circuit-simulation files can be added if
  seen necessary
  
### Code style
* arduino codes as c or c++
* prefer to build sensor interface codes on pc end with python
* use pep-8
